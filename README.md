Mode

A virtual wardrobe application.

Overview

This was many years in the making for me. I had always saved pictures of the clothes I had bought in a virtual wardrobe on my phone then used an editing app to create outfits. Maybe a little strange but it turned out to be really efficient and I soon had friends asking me to do the same for them. It was always in the back of my mind that I wanted to do this, I knew there were apps that existed already but I found them clunky and not very visually appealing.

Queue 'Mode' (Swedish word for fashion), a MEAN stack RESTful app, built using my own API and designed using bootstrap and SASS. I initially envisioned it as a Ruby on Rails app however I decided practising my Angular.js would be more beneficial in the current market so made the switch and managed to get an MVP within four days of starting the project.

The biggest focus for me was ensuring a slick customer journey and beautiful visuals, I wanted something that myself and my friends would actually want to use.

Built With

jQuery, JavaScript, ES6, CSS, HTML, BCrypt, TDD, Tokens, Ajax, JSON, Express, Node.js, Mongoose, Mongo, SCSS, Bootstrap, Gulp and Bower

Visual Inspiration

I decided to keep the colour scheme very minimal and already knew that I wanted the site to have a minimalist theme. I was inspired my Net-A-Porter, COS and &otherstories sites who had white backgrounds, accent colours and focused on the imagery to display there branding.

How it works

Once the user logs in or registered they are taken to the landing page. From here they have the option to view their wardrobe (individual clothing items) or full outfits.

On the item page they will be shown all of their items and be able to click on the hanger to add any. I toyed with a few different ways of the user selecting their items as I wanted it to be as easy as possible. Therefore as this is primarily mobile phone focused I decided users would search on google images or similar for their items and be able to upload them to their wardrobes that way.

On the outfit pages the user is presented with their wardrobe and an option to name their outfit choice. They then select as many items as they want to create the full outfit, this is displayed on the outfit page.


Planning

Wireframing

I used both written and online wireframes to work out the user-journey and ensure that I had captured all of the elements needed. I initially worked from a mobile responsive viewpoint as, after speaking to various friends about this idea they suggested this would be the most useful version of the app.

Staying On Track

I utilised trello as a project management tool, dividing my goals into days and outlining any blockers so I could move on to other tasks whilst stuck.

Future Developments

I would very much like to turn this into a proper app and am hoping to embark on an Ionic project soon so I can do this. I also think it's very important to include a social element to this where users can follow other people (be it friends, bloggers, stylists, celebrities) and like and share their own outfits. It would also be great to explore the rise in online receipts and have users be able to upload this to the app, then the items to appear in their wardrobe automatically.
